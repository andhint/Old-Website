              <p>
              At the beginning of this year I noticed a few of my friends were doing the 365 day challenge on Instagram. To partipate in the challenge you need to take a photo everyday and post it to instagram for 365 days (or 366 since 2016 is a leap year). I figured that, like most new years resolutions, the majority of people starting the challenge wouldn't make it to the end of the year. So I thought by looking at the number of times a certain day was tagged (i.e. #day42) I could find a trend.

              <p>During my freshman year of college I started to longboard with my friend Nick. That summer we decided to try and make our own boards. We went through many designs and types of presses and ended up with a hybrid of many of the ideas we saw online and elsewhere. I honestly think our way of making boards is one of the better/cheaper ways for amateur board makers, especially those who may only want to make one or two of each board. If you're planning to make more than that, I'd recommend making a more robust press. We've since stopped making boards so I don't have as many pictures as I'd like of the process. I'll try to make models whereever I can to help clear things up. </p>

              <p>One year in college I was taking a class on orbital mechanics. We were reviewing the N-body problem and I thought it might be fun to simulate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem">three-body probloem</a>. Almost all solutions to this have to be solved numerically, only a few special cases have algebraic solutions. I didn't have too much experience with any numerical solving methods at the time so I came up with something that made sense to me. It ended up basically being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler Method</a>. If I were to redo I would use a different numerical method or even one of MATLABs ODE solvers to get something a little more accurate.</p>
