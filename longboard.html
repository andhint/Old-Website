        <p>During my freshman year of college I started to longboard with my friend Nick. That summer we decided to try and make our own boards. We went through many designs and types of presses and ended up with a hybrid of many of the ideas we saw online and elsewhere. I honestly think our way of making boards is one of the better/cheaper ways for amateur board makers, especially those who may only want to make one or two of each board. If you're planning to make more than that, I'd recommend making a more robust press. We've since stopped making boards so I don't have as many pictures as I'd like of the process. I'll try to make models wherever I can to help clear things up.
        </p>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Basically, to make a longboard you need a press, some plies of wood, and some glue. The plies of wood are all glued together and then put into the press. The press has a mold inside that bends the plies of wood into a certain shape and holds it there via bolts or vacuum pressure until the glue is done drying. Once the glue is dry, the wood is removed from the press and then cut out into the desired shape.
        </p>

        <h4>The Press</h4>
        <p>There are few different types of presses for amateur board builders.
          <ul>
            <li>Rail press - This is the simplest of them all. This was the first press I built, the experience I got from it was nice but I wouldn't recommend making one. It's hard to get even pressure across the plies and it's only possible to build concave into the board. <a href="https://www.silverfishlongboarding.com/forum/longboard-board-building-q-a-discussions/163631-rail-press.html">Example</a></li>
            <li>Rib Press/Bolt Press - This method consists of creating a series of clamps that extend down the length of the board. Each clamp has the concave profile cut into it. A rib press will create a nicely made board however I found this way to be to work/time intensive. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Comprehensive-Longboard-Guide/step6/Bolt-longboard-press-Building-the-rib-clamps/">Example</a></li>
            <li>Vacuum Press - This method works by creating a mold and placing it and the glued up plies into a vacuum bag. There is no positive and negative mold like most of the other methods. The vacuum bag pulls down the plies to fit to the mold. This is probably one of the more used and easier ways to press a board provided you have the right equipment. We tried this method but the air compressor we used to power our vacuum pump made too much noise so we decided not to use a vacuum press. If you're looking to use this method I've heard some good things about <a herf="http://www.roarockit.com/">Roarockit.</a> Here is an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Vacuum-Bending-Skateboard-Veneers/step5/Evacuating-Air-From-The-Bag/">example.</a></li>
            <li>Dimm Press - A press that uses a positive and negative mold made out of foam. Made by a guy who goes by the name Dimm online. The method I use is very similar to this. Here's a <a href="https://vimeo.com/5084011">video </a> of Dimm explaining his press.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Building the Press</h4>
          <p>
            Our press is essentially a giant clamp. It consists of two pieces of plywood with a series of carriage bolts running down either side to pull each piece of plywood together. We had about 6 carriages bolts spaced 8-10" apart down the length of the press. The board blanks we created were 12" wide so we made sure our press was at least 14" wide to accommodate the blank and the bolts.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing worth noting is that our first press was made with basically the first piece of plywood we saw at Lowes. We noticed that once we started pressing the boards, the plywood started to bend a quite a bit. We upgraded to stiffer plywood and noticed that the press bent less once tightened down. This certainly helps distribute the pressure across the mold more evenly.
          </p>

        <h4>Creating the Mold</h4>
          <p>
            To create the mold we used foam board insulation that you can pick up at any home improvement store. The idea is to create a positive and negative mold that fit together. With some careful cutting you can cut this from one piece of foam. To cut the foam we used a hot wire foam cutter that we made. This consists of a piece of nichrome wire(some people have used steel guitar strings) stretched between two points with electricity flowing through it. We made a jig using some scrap wood, a small transformer (to throttle the power going through the wire), and a spring to keep it tensioned. The spring is important because as the wire heats up it will expand so the spring is necessary to keep it taught so a straight line will be cut.
          </p>
          <p>
            To actually cut the mold, we assembled some wooden profiles of the camber and concave and pinned them into the sides. These serve as a way to guide the hot wire cutter through the foam. When we cut we would make sure to have one person on each side to be sure the wire was moving at the same rate on each side. This was to make sure we had a nice even cut. It's good idea to have the wooden profiles extend past the length of the foam. This makes for a good starting point for the wire cutter. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7ybwDAJD4">video</a> is a good example of a hot wire cutter being used to cut a concave profile into a piece of foam using the wooden guides.
          </p>
          <p>
            For attaching the mold to the pieces of plywood we would use spray adhesive. This does make it hard to switch different molds out of the press however. Once the foam has been glued to the plywood removing it one piece can be quite difficult. I've heard some people have had some success with nailing through the press so that the nails come through just slightly. Then placing the foam on the nails to hold it in place. I haven't tried it, but it might be worth looking into.
          </p>
          

          
        <h4>Materials</h4>
          <h5>Wood</h5>
            <p>
              Most people build their boards with either baltic birch (BB) or maple. Baltic Birch usually comes in 5' x 5' sheets in thicknesses of 1/8" or 1/4". If you decide to use Baltic Birch I would recommend using the 1/8" thickness. We started using the 1/4" BB and found that after the board was removed from the press the board would flatten out due to the glued in stresses. The 1/8" BB would hold its shape much better. We would use a table saw to cut these 5' x 5' sheets into smaller rectangles(we called them blanks) that could fit into our press. From one sheet we could get one 1' x 5' blank and five 1' x 4' blanks.
            </p>
            <p>
              We never used maple so I don't have much to say about it. I've heard it usually come in 1/16" thickness. The 1/16" thickness is nicer in that it holds its shape better and allows for more dramatic curves in your board (i.e dropdecks with deep concave). However, it also needs more glue and takes longer to glue up before putting in the press.
            </p>
            <p>
              One key difference between the BB and maple to keep in mind is the direction of the grain. Maple comes in 1/16" and is only one ply. Baltic Birch that's 1/8" thick is generally three plies glues together (1/4" is usually five). When these are glued up the top and bottom sheet have the grain going in the same direction and the middle ply has the grain going perpendicular to the other two. This gives the final plywood more strength in different directions and give your board more torsional strength. We found that it's better to have more plies going from the nose to the tail of your board. So when cutting the 5' x 5' sheets of BB we cut them in way that gives us more blanks that have the grain going along the length of the blank. Since BB has this built into each sheet you buy, it's possible to get away with ignoring this. But if you're using maple where you're dealing with single plies you'll need to make sure to throw in some blanks in going the perpendicular to the length of the board. I would have 2 blanks with grain going from the nose to the tail of the board for every 1 blank going side to side.
            </p>
            <p>
              To get the wood I recommend calling up local lumberyards to see what they have in stock. Do not go to Home Depot/Lowes/etc. Our first board was made of BB from Lowes and it turns out it's actually just veneered pine. We stepped on the board and the middle of the board sank until it touched the ground. There are some places to buy online like <a href="http://www.roarockit.com/">Roarockit</a>. Just keep in mind that most of the information I talked about has to do with wood from a lumberyard and things might be different if ordering online.
            </p>
          <h5>Glue</h5>
            <p>
              We used Titebond glue for all of our boards except for when we used fiberglass in between plies where we would use West System Epoxy. I would avoid using Titebond Original as it is not water resistant and is only recommended for interior projects. Titebond III is stronger, more water resistant, and offers a longer open time. We had no problems with boards made with Titebond II but if you want a little more insurance and a longer time to glue everything up it might be worth spending a few extra dollars for Titebond III. We generally got the gallon size of Titebond II/III from a local hardware store and the epoxy we got from a marine supply store. I won't go into fiberglassing/epoxy right now because that could be a whole other post.
            </p>
          <h5>Paint/Top Coat</h5>
            <p>
              For painting your board pretty much anything will work. We would use spray paint, acrylic, and eventually we had our own spray gun but anything that gets the desired look will work. Once it's been painted (or maybe you decided not to) it needs a top coat. This helps keep water out and protect the board. We used spar urethane for our top coats. Generally we would do 3 to 4 coats of it. Keep in mind your board will probably get scratched up from riding so having a thicker top coat might protect whatever design you painted on for longer. We used regular urethane at first but found it would yellow after a while so we switched to spar urethane. If you want a nice shiny board you can do some wet sanding when the top coat is done to get a nice shine.
            </p>
          
        <h4>Pressing the Board</h4>
          <p>
              <ol>
                <li><h6>Pick out the blanks to use and draw on your design</h6></li>
                  <p>I highly recommend drawing a centerline on the top sheet before doing anything else. It helps you to line up your template and make sure everything is nicely aligned once in the press. We would usually make a template out of rolls of paper drop cloth from Lowes (basically a roll of thick construction paper). We would cut out whatever shape we wanted for the board, line it up with the centerline, and trace on the design. When you're done you can roll it up for later and use it again. Also, if you don't plan on painting your blanks, pick out which ones you want on top and bottom. Some of them might have a better looking grain pattern then others or won't have any plugs in it. </p>
                <li><h6>Gather everything you need</h6></li>
                  <p>Get everything you'll need for pressing the board together. When you're gluing everything up you want to be as quick as possible before the glues open time has ended. Having everything ready lets you move quickly. This would include: the press and all its nuts and bolts ready to go, drop cloth, glue, something to spread the glue with, wrenches for tightening the press, and a clean area to lay everything up in. </p>
                <li><h6>Glue up your blanks and assemble them all into one stack</h6></li>
                  <p>When we glued up our blanks we spread a layer of glue on each ply that was contacting another. We found that having enough glue where you could just see the grain coming through was a good amount. Any more than that will just be squeezed out once it's in the press anyways. Generally we'd have one person pouring glue on the blank and another spreading it with squeegee. Once both surfaces are glued you can put them together and move on to gluing the next blank. Once they're all assembled into one stack make sure they're properly aligned because they might move around a bit once they've been glued. </p>
                <li><h6>Put the stack of blanks into your press</h6></li>
                  <p>Line up the stack of blanks using the centerline as a reference. Make sure all the blanks are still in a nice stack.</p>
                <li><h6>Place the top part of the press on and tighten it down</h6></li>
                  <p>Put the mold together with the stack of glued up blanks in between. Place the nuts onto the bolts and start tightening everything down. Make sure to tighten everything down evenly. We would use a ruler to make sure each nut had gotten tightened by the same amount. Make sure not to tighten too much that the board starts cracking. You might need to use a paper towel or rag to wipe any excess glue being squeezed out of the press. </p>
                <li><h6>Wait for 24 hours (or however long it takes your glue to fully cure)</h6></li>
                  <p>Now all that's left to do is wait for the glue to fully cure. For whatever adhesive you use, make sure you read the instructions. Many times it may seem straight forwards, but there can be steps you need to take for more efficient use that aren't always apparent.</p>
              </ol>
          </p>
        <h4>Cutting and Shaping the Board</h4>
          <p>
            Once the board is out of the press, we would cut out the board using a jigsaw. However, if you have access to a band saw I'd highly recommend that. It's much easier to get a nicer even edge with a band saw than a jigsaw due to the curves in the board. Afterwards, we would sand it down to even out the edge and remove and glue or defects. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, is to drill your holes for the trucks. We would use a hand drill but again, having a drill press would ensure much nicely drilled holes. If you're making a top mounted board drill from the bottom of your board towards the deck. This ensures that holes from the board and the truck line up nicely so you won't have any issues putting the bolts through. If you're making a drop through board do the opposite. If you're using a drill press it shouldn't be much of an issue but if you're using a hand drill I would recommend it. It's just due to error made by hand holding the drill. Another important thing to keep in mind is blowout. When the drill exits through the other side of the board it will likely pull some of the wood with it in a really ugly manner. We would clamp piece of scrap wood to the bottom of whatever we were drilling to minimize this. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're making a drop through board there are some templates available online. We would drill holes to remove the material and file/sand to finish. It can be a tough thing to do so I wouldn't recommend it for your first board you make. We experimented a bit with making a template for a router to cut out the hole. We didn't have any success but I feel with a little more work we could have had it.
          </p>
        <h4>Finishing</h4>
          <p>
            Once all that is done, all that's left to do is paint it and coat it with a waterproof coat. Put some grip tape on and add the trucks and wheels then the board is finished!
          </p>
