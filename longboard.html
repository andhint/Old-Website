        <p>During my freshman year of college I started to longboard with my friend Nick. That summer we decided to try and make our own boards. We went through many designs and types of presses and ended up with a hybrid of many of the ideas we saw online and elsewhere. I honestly think our way of making boards is one of the better/cheaper ways for amateur board makers, especially those who may only want to make one or two of each board. If you're planning to make more than that, I'd recommend making a more robust press. We've since stopped making boards so I don't have as many pictures as I'd like of the process. I'll try to make models whereever I can to help clear things up.
        </p>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Basically, to make a longboard you need a press, some plies of wood, and some glue. The plies of wood are all glued together and then put into the press. The press has a mold inside that bends the plies of wood into a certain shape and holds it there via bolts or vacuum pressure until the glue is done drying. Once the glue is dry, the wood is removed from the press and then cut out into the desired shape.
        </p>

        <h4>The Press</h4>
        <p>There are few different types of presses for amateur board builders.
          <ul>
            <li>Rail press - This is the simplest of them all. This was the first press I built, the experience I got from it was nice but I wouldn't recommend making one. It's hard to get even pressure across the plies and it's only possible to build concave into the board. <a href="https://www.silverfishlongboarding.com/forum/longboard-board-building-q-a-discussions/163631-rail-press.html">Example</a></li>
            <li>Rib Press/Bolt Press - This method consists of creating a series of clamps that extend down the length of the board. Each clamp has the concave profile cut into it. A rib press will create a nicely made board however I found this way to be to work/time intensive. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Comprehensive-Longboard-Guide/step6/Bolt-longboard-press-Building-the-rib-clamps/">Example</a></li>
            <li>Vacuum Press - This method works by creating a mold and placing it and the glued up plies into a vacuum bag. There is no positive and negative mold like most of the other methods. The vacuum bag pulls down the plies to fit to the mold. This is probably one of the more used and easier ways to press a board provided you have the right equipment. We tried this method but the air compressor we used to power our vacuum pump made too much noise so we decided not to use a vacuum press. If you're looking to use this method I've heard some good things about <a herf="http://www.roarockit.com/">Roarockit.</a> Here is an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Vacuum-Bending-Skateboard-Veneers/step5/Evacuating-Air-From-The-Bag/">example.</a></li>
            <li>Dimm Press - A press that uses a positive and negative mold made out of foam. Made by a guy who goes by the name Dimm online. The method I use is very similar to this. Here's a <a href="https://vimeo.com/5084011">video </a> of Dimm explaining his press.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Building the Press</h4>
          <p>
            Our press is essentially a giant clamp. It consists of two pieces of plywood with a series of carriage bolts running down either side to pull each piece of plywood together. We had about 6 carriages bolts spaced 8-10" apart down the length of the press. The board blanks we created were 12" wide so we made sure our press was at least 14" wide to accomdate the blank and the bolts.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing worth noting is that our first press was made with basically the first piece of plywood we saw at Lowes. We noticed that once we started pressing the boards, the plywood started to bend a quite a bit. We upgraded to stiffer plywood and noticed that the press bent less once tightened down. This certainly helps distribute the pressure across the mold more evenly.
          </p>

        <h4>Creating the Mold</h4>
          <p>
            To create the mold we used foam board insulation that you can pick up at any home improvement store. The idea is to create a positive and negative mold that fit together. With some careful cutting you can cut this from one piece of foam. To cut the foam we used a hot wire foam cutter that we made. This consists of a piece of nichrome wire(some people have used steel guitar strings) stretched betweeen two points with electricity flowing through it. We made a jig using some scrap wood, a small transformer (to throttle the power going through the wire), and a spring to keep it tensioned. The spring is important because as the wire heats up it will expand so the spring is necessary to keep it taught so a straight line will be cut.
          </p>
          <p>
            To actually cut the mold, we assembled some wooden profiles of the camber and concave and pinned them into the sides. These serve as a way to guide the hot wire cutter through the foam. When we cut we would make sure to have one person on each side to be sure the wire was moving at the same rate on each side. This was to make sure we had a nice even cut. It's good idea to have the wooden profiles extend past the length of the foam. This makes for a good starting point for the wire cutter. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs7ybwDAJD4">video</a> is a good example of a hot wire cutter being used to cut a concave profile into a piece of foam using the wooden guides.
