          Schlieren photography is an imaging technique that allows to visualize changes in fluid density. It is often used in aeronautical engineering to visualize the flow of air and shockwaves. I first heard about it through some of my classes. It really interested me because I've always had an interest with photography (especially with things like long exposure where it's possible to visualize things that aren't normally visible) and had applications with engineering. Soon after learning about schlieren photography I got a chance to see Gary Settles talk at my school. He's one of the world's experts on schlieren imaging. After seeing him speak I really wanted to give it a try myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the simplest schlieren system a light source, a parabolic or spherical mirror, a knife's edge, and a camera are all needed. I used a LED flashlight for the light source, though this probably isn't ideal. From my research, the light source should be as close to a point source as possible. The mirror I got from Edmond Optics. It was 150mm diameter 1500mm focal distance (FD) spherical mirror. I chose this mirror as it was big enough for decent sized subject and the focal length allowed me to it within my house (the distance required is two times the focal length). For the camera  I used my Canon t3i and later my friend brought his Canon 6D which we took most of the shots with. Finally, for the knife's edge I used a razor blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's some of the images we got. Look below for some info on how everything was set up. There's two things I wanted to note about the results. The subject and it's image (the one on the left) were both in the shot because we had limited space to work with. Ideally we could move things around to isolate the image. Secondly, the rings seen in the mirror can be explained by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_knife-edge_test">Foucault knife-edge test</a>.

          <h5>The Set-up</h5>
          <p>
            When setting everything up we quickly found out everything needs to be very precise. Ideally, we would be doing this in a lab where everything could be precisely aligned and leveled. Even so, we managed and figured out a few tricks along the way to align everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing we did was set up the mirror at one end of the room. We put it on top of a small end table so it would be at the same level with the camera on the tripod. I made a small mount for the mirror out of some scrap wood I had. I epoxied the mirror to the mount and made some adjustable feet so everything could be fine tuned later. Next, we set up the LED flashlight by taping it to a separate tripod. Directly, adjacent we set up the camera (with a telephoto lens) on another tripod. The light source and knife's edge should both be at distance of two time the focal length away form the mirror. The camera should be slightly behind the knife's edge. For this mirror this meant we had to separate everything from the mirror by 3000mm (~10ft). We struggled at first, but we came up with a trick using the reflected image to get the correct distance. 
          </p>
          <p>
            First, set up the mirror and the light source so that the image will be reflected to one side of the light source. Take a piece of blank paper and hold in the path of the reflected light. The image should appear on the piece of paper. By moving the paper back and forth, find a point where the image comes into focus. When properly aligned the distance between the mirror/focused image and the mirror/light source should be equal. If the focused image is closer to the mirror, move the light source closer to the mirror until they are the same (and vice versa).
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, adjust the camera so that the image is reflected nicely into the lens. This will probably depend on the camera being used and the size of the lens but for us, this was a few inches behind the where the knife's edge will be placed (where the reflected image was in focus from the previous step). We used the live view function on our cameras which was very helpful when aligning everything so we didn't have to be looking through the view finder the whole time. We also found it helpful to have someone stand behind the mirror and look down the barrel of the lens. The person behind the mirror can see how light is hitting the optics and can direct the person aligning the camera.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once that's setup, the knife's edge needs to be placed. To set this up correctly it's best to have a subject to observe to see when the effect begins. I would recommend using a candle as the effect is quite noticeable. Ideally, the subject should be placed so that only the image of the subject is visible in camera. We didn't have much space so we chose to just focus on the image and have the subject in the frame as well. If possible move the camera farther away from the light source. This should give enough room so that the subject isn't in the frame. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We used a series of books on an end table to get the knife's edge to the correct level. The razor blade was taped to the end of small piece of wood for easy handling. The block with razor blade taped to it sat on top of the stack of books. With live view on (or watching through the view finder) move the knife's edge across the focused image until the schlieren image becomes visible. For us, this was about 2/3rds of the way across the image.
          </p>
          <p>
            We found live view to be helpful when setting things up but also had some problems when actually taking pictures. Many times it would look perfect in live view but when taking the picture half of the picture would end up black. After some experimentation we found we had better results at higher shutter speeds. However, it still wasn't perfect. We thought it might have something to do with the way the shutter advances. So we moved the knife's edge to come from the other side and sure enough our pictures started coming out just how we saw in live view. If it helps anyone, originally we had it blocking light from the left side, then moved it to come from the right side when using a Canon camera.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that you should be able to setup your own schlieren photography system. I hope this has been of some help, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have questions. Good luck!
